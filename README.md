# preferences_urban_interventions

**1.** This repository is a result of the data collected and the analysis conducted for my master thesis titled "Perceptions of Urban Change: Exploring Before-and-After Visual Preferences for Mobility". It aims to be totally open-source for replication purposes.

**2.** The online survey, developed in Limesurvey,  remains available at the following link (https://ushift.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~ushift.daemon/limesurvey/index.php/562461?lang=en), and participants are still welcome to complete it and explore its interactive, panoramic and innovative format. The survey can be briefly resumed by the following: 


 &nbsp;&nbsp; **2.1** Participants were asked to **select their preferred urban space** from a pair of panoramic and interactive street view images from _Google Street View_, representing the before and after a given intervention, with the ability to navigate and explore each scenario. 
  
 &nbsp;&nbsp; **2.2** They were also also asked to grade seven perceptual factors in a 5-Point Scale by level of influence in the previous choice. These perceptual factors are _comfort_, _order_, _livability_, _security_, _safety_, _usefulness_ and _stress_. 
  
 &nbsp;&nbsp; **2.3** Answer to 15 questions about their: (a) **socio-demographics**:  age, gender, number of children, age of children, disability, pets, occupation, city of residence, nationality; (b) **background on urban planning**; (c) **travel behavior**:  commute modes, commute time, car ownership, parking availability 


All interventions (pairs of before-and-after images) explored (embedded in the survey) are available in my Notion profile: https://www.notion.so/Survey-Groups-211188b0f7a980f7b1faf96b14d1a42e?source=copy_link
